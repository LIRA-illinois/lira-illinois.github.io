Our paper titled "D-AnoGAN: Anomaly Detection in Disconnected Data Manifolds with Generative Adversarial Networks" was accepted to [IJCNN 2022](https://wcci2022.org/)! We explore the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection in disconnected data manifolds. We show that a multi-generator network can be combined with a bandit to learn to cluster data into different manifolds, leading to improved performance on several datasets. This work was led by Walker Dimon.
