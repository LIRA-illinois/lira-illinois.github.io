Our paper titled ["WayFAST: Navigation with Predictive Traversability in the Field"](/files/wayfast.pdf) was accepted to [IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7083369)! We present a new method for robot navigation in the field using traversability estimations. This work was in collaboration with Dr. Girish Chowdhary.
