Our paper titled "Coordination in Ad Hoc Teams with Generalized Policy Improvement" was accepted for a 5 minute lightning talk at the IROS 2023 [Multi-Agent Learning Workshop](https://djhanove.github.io/IROS23_MRS/)! We show that generalized policy improvement allows an agent to leverage prior training for fast adadptation to new teammates in cooperative tasks. This work was led by Rupal Nigam.
