Our paper titled ["Context-Aware Inefficiency of Self-Interested Agents in UAV Wildfire Fighting"](/files/social-cost.pdf) was accepted to the [AIAA Journal of Information Systems](https://arc.aiaa.org/journal/JAIS)! This work proposes a state-dependent price of anarchy metric for measuring the inefficiency of self-interested agents and applies that metric to study potential inefficiencies in wildfire fighting with teams of unmanned aerial vehicles. The work was led by Niket Parikh.

Our paper titled ["A Survey of Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Aviation and Future Outlooks"](/files/jais-irl.pdf) was also accepted to the [AIAA Journal of Information Systems](https://arc.aiaa.org/journal/JAIS)! We survey algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), their current use for aviation problems, and potential future applications in aviation. The work was led by Rupal Nigam.
