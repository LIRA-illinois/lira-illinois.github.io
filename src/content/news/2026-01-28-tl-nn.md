Our paper titled ["Neuro-Symbolic Generation of Explanations for Robot Policies with Weighted Signal Temporal Logic"](/files/tl-nn.pdf) was accepted to [IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7083369)! We propose a method for inferring the weighted signal temporal logic specification that best explains a given robot policy, along with three explainability metrics. The work was led by Miki Yuasa.
