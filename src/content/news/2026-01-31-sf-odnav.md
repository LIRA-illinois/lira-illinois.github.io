Our paper titled "SF-ODNav: Successor Feature Framework for Map-less Target-Driven Outdoor Visual Navigation" was accepted to [ICRA 2026](https://2026.ieee-icra.org/)! We propose a reinforcement learning method for navigating to a target location based on an image of the location. This work was in collaboration with Dr. Girish Chowdhary.
