This work leverages successor features (SFs) to disentangle an individual agent’s impact on a shared reward from that of all other agents, thus addressing multi-agent credit assignment when training decentralized agents. The video shows an example of gameplay from the Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) where the red agents learned to surround the blue agents and win the game, despite being at a numbers disadvantage (27 vs. 30 agents). See our AAMAS 2022 paper presenting our approach, named **DISentangling Successor features for Coordination (DISSC)**, for more details.
