This work explores the problem of anomaly detection in disconnected data manifolds (i.e., multi-class anomaly detection) using a new combination of multi-generator generative adversarial networks (GANs) that leverages a learned bandit for clustering in the latent space. See our IJCNN 2022 paper presenting our approach, named **Disconnected Anomaly GAN (D-AnoGAN)**, for more details.
