This work proposes a Markov chain model of pathfinder operations&mdash;i.e., the process of selecting exploratory, or pathfinder, flights to determine if an arrival or departure gate that was closed due to weather conditions can now be re-opened. We then use this model to analyze the steady-state behavior of such operations and conduct a worse-case scenario analysis. This work was in collaboration with Jimin Choi, Kartikeya Anand, and Prof. Max Li from the University of Michigan and Dr. Husni Idris from NASA.
