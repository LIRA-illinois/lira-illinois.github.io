	<figcaption>High-level view of our proposed approach for understanding the inefficiency of Markov game agents. Our key idea is to estimate the inefficiency of self-interested agents with respect to a social objective using a state-dependent formulation of price of anarchy.</figcaption>

This work explores ways to evaluate and predict the social cost induced by agents acting according to their own selfish objectives. Our approach leverages value functions from policies optimized for the social objective, modeled as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MMDP), and individual agent objectives, modeled as a Markov game (MG), to **predict a social cost metric for any given state.** See our 2025 AIAA SciTech Forum paper for more details.
