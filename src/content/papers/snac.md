	<figcaption>Value maps for two learned sub-policies. The object-based option is learned using features specialized to focus on dynamic objects - it appears to have the blue agent prevent the enemy agent (E) from reaching the blue flag (blue star). The spatial-based option is learning using spatial features and is independent of the enemy.</figcaption>

Inspired by recent discoveries in neuroscience, this work explores the use of feature specialization and clustering to decompose environments into a useful task subspace for HRL. See our [ALA Workshop at AAMAS 2022](https://ala2022.github.io/#) paper presenting our approach, named **Specialized Neurons and Clustering (SNAC)**, for more details.
