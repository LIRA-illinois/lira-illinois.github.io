We work on algorithms for robots to adapt to new teammates in ad hoc multi-robot teams.

<!-- ## Generalized policy improvement for coordination in ad hoc teams -->

<!-- This work proposes a method, **generalized policy improvement with successor features for ad hoc teaming (GSAT)**, for a robot to adapt to new teammates in zero-shot and online adaptation settings. See our [IROS 2023 Workshop on Advances in Multi-Agent Learning](https://djhanove.github.io/IROS23_MRS/) paper presenting our method for more details. -->
