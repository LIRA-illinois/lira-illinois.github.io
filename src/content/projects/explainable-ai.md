We work on methods to explain the behaviors autonomous agents, with a focus on those that use artificial intelligence-based decision making policies. One way we do this is by inferring the objectives of a policy&mdash;in the form of a temporal logic specification&mdash;using neurosymbolic or heuristic search methods.

We are also working on methods to create autonomous agents that are explainable-by-design, with an emphasis on integrating formal methods&mdash;like temporal logic&mdash;with hierarchical reinforcement learning.
