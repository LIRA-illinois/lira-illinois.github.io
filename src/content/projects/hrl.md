We work on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) methods to create autonomous agents that can efficiently solve complex tasks. We use hierarchies to improve, for example, sample efficiency in complex navigation tasks. We also work on discovering useful subtasks, with an emphasis on subtasks for highly dynamic and stochastic environments, like those with adversarial agents. Finally, we also showed that hierarchies can improve adaptation to new dynamics.
