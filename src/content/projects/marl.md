We work on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for coordinating agents in cooperative tasks, such as search-and-rescue, surveillance missions, and warehouse robotics.

We work on co-designing multi-agent decision policies and the communication network that supports them. We also focus on addressing multi-agent credit assignment, a fundamental problem in MARL where agents must figure out which agent's action contributed to a received reward.

<!-- ## Coordination machines for minimizing communications in MARL

This work proposes **coordination machines (CMs)**, a hierarchical model for minimizing communications in MARL subject to a desired overall task success rate. Our key idea is that each subtask may require different levels of communication, and varying the level of communication allowed for each subtask can lower overall communication costs. See our [CoCoMARL RLC 2024 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/cocomarl-2024/home?authuser=0) paper presenting our method for more details. -->
